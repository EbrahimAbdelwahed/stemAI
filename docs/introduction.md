# Introduction to STEM AI Assistant

## Overview

STEM AI Assistant is a sophisticated chatbot application designed specifically for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and research. It combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities to provide accurate, contextual responses to STEM-related queries.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the STEM AI Assistant is to:

1. **Enhance STEM Learning**: Provide accessible, accurate explanations for complex STEM concepts
2. **Support Research**: Help researchers quickly find relevant information from their documents
3. **Improve Accessibility**: Make STEM knowledge more available to students, educators, and professionals
4. **Provide Customization**: Allow users to choose different AI models to suit their specific needs

## Key Differentiators

What sets the STEM AI Assistant apart:

- **STEM-Focused**: Unlike general-purpose chatbots, this assistant is specifically optimized for STEM subjects
- **Multiple AI Models**: Support for different LLMs (Grok-3-mini and Gemini 2.0 Flash) provides flexibility and varied capabilities
- **Document Integration**: Users can upload their own documents, which the assistant can reference in its responses
- **Semantic Search**: Advanced embedding-based search helps find the most relevant information
- **Modern User Experience**: Real-time streaming responses, dark mode support, and responsive design

## Technology Stack

The STEM AI Assistant is built using a modern technology stack:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes with server-side functions
- **AI Integration**: Vercel AI SDK for simplified LLM interactions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector for vector similarity search
- **Hosting**: Optimized for deployment on Vercel

## Target Audience

The STEM AI Assistant is designed for:

- Students at all levels seeking help with STEM subjects
- Educators looking for teaching assistance
- Researchers who need to quickly query their research materials
- Professionals in STEM fields seeking quick reference
